This is a news feed application that fetches news from the hackernews api built with Nextjs. This application fetches a total of 500 news feeds but only displays 50 news headlines on its first render. Everytime the user scrolls, a custom hook (infinite scroll hook) renders more news headlines on the page. Material UI was used as well as simple CSS styling.
